1) Laser beam divergence (why dots grow apart)

Watch: Laser Beam Divergence Experiment with Sam Houston — shows how a laser spot spreads with distance so you “see” divergence, not just hear about it.

2) Optics & collimation (how lenses shape the beam)

Watch: Collimate a Laser with a Shear-Plate / Lab Demo on Collimators — practical demos of collimating light and beam expanders so you learn how to make a beam less divergent.

3) Parallel vs crossing (zeroing) — the exact aiming tradeoff

Watch: Zeroing your Laser: Parallel vs Converging Zeros (and Parallel Zeroing for Dummies) — explains the difference between making beams truly parallel vs making them meet at a chosen zero distance. Very close to the real-world decision you asked about.

4) Visible vs infrared (why some beams aren’t seen)

Watch: Science In A Minute: What is Infrared Light? — short and clear on why IR is invisible to your eyes/scope and how cameras can reveal it.

(Optional) 5) Measurement / deeper numbers (spot size, mrad)

Watch: BeamGage Tutorial: Spot Size and Divergence — if you want hard numbers (mrad, spot diameter at range), this shows measurement methods.
